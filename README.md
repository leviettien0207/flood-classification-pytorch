# flood-classification-pytorch
Dataset: [extracted a part from YFCC100M](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rRp1JPAh6AxnB8c02uVF7i4Hr0pO0sBx/view?usp=sharing)
This dataset has both text and image.

This is just my small project to get used to pytorch. I have searched many blogs, tutorials on internet.
The steps are:
- Customize and prepare dataset to PyTorch-able dataset
- Tuning (I prefer to call play around literally) Bert pretrained text model
- Tuning (I prefer to call play around literally) wide resnet pretrained image model - I lost this part :D
- Combine those two above models and tuning
